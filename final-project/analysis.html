<h1> Analysis </h1>

<br>

<div class="paper">
<p>Although it was a small sample size&comma; it&apos;s worth looking through all the answers everyone gave a bit more in-depth.<br>
The interviews page only contains brief summaries of the interviews&comma; so here is all of the little pieces of data gathered through the interview process.

<h2>Basic Takeaways</h2>
</div>

<br>

<div class="paper">
<p>2&#47;3 people have been collecting for years.<br>
The items collected were plushies&comma; albums&comma; and video games.<br>
2&#47;3 people said they would part with their most valuable possesion.<br>
All said price doesn&apos;t really matter that much.
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="cellheading">
<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
</div>

<br>

<div class="paper">

<p>Although everyone said similar yet different things when it came to the subject&comma; it was interesting how the medium of their collections impacted their thinking. Something like a computer or game is easy to replace and upgrade&comma; while
plushies or music can be replaced if broken or torn&comma; doesn&apos;t warrant replacement the same way the former does. Those things are tools and usually become out of date&comma; warranting an upgrade at some point.<br><br>
I find it interesting that everyone said price isn&apos;t really an important aspect. Yes&comma; the sentiment of something or just the fact that it&apos;s been obtained is what really matters&comma; but I&apos;d expect money to matter more when it came to something&apos;s value.<br><br>
A lot of the differences in general came from the different things they collect. In an era where companies are leaning more heavily on digital distribution&comma; you could argue whether or not someone truly &quot;owns&quot; something&comma; which reflects in the way people collect certain things.
Some things are also just more accessible&comma; with more ways to acquire them&comma; including less-than-ethical methods such as pirating digital media.<br><br>
Though at the end of the day&comma; these people collect what they love. It doesn&apos;t matter what it is or how much they have&comma; because it&apos;s their passion.

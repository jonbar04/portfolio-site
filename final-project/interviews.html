<h1> Interviews </h1>

<div class="section">

<h1>Interview 1: Alexander Muniz</h1>
<p>“It’s a comfort object. And that’s the easiest way to explain it. The world can be crashing down, and I still have my stuffed dog.”<br><br>
Alexander is a collector of plushies. They hold a special place in his heart, and he uses them as a way to start a conversation, similar to people who wear shirts of bands they like.
He believes that objects gain significance over the years, being able to create memories with the journeys you take them on. Some of the significance may come from landmarks or rarity, but mostly it's about making those memories and photographing the journey together.
He also refuses to part with his collection, it doesn't matter how much money he can get from selling it off, because the memories he made are priceless.
</p>

<h1> Interview 2: Roman Hunter</h1>
<p>“Even a pre-built computer can end up becoming something you can truly call your own”<br><br>
Roman is a collector of music, being newer to collecting, but still having pride in his journey. Despite primarily collecting albums, he claims that his most prized possession is his computer.
Computers are a special case, since although you can just buy one off a shelf, you can also make one yourself and/or continue modifying one as the years go by.
What makes this case even more interesting, is that despite it being his most valuable possession, Roman said he'd be willing to part with it. This is of course due to the nature of a tool such as a computer.
While some would call it crazy to part with "your most valuable possession," tools can always be upgraded and replaced. And in the modern era, it's become quite easy to preserve digital media, leading to it becoming sort of a no-brainer.
</p>

<h1>Interview 3: Gabriel Mendez</h1>
<p>“The value after the purchase is how I feel as the moment it's in my hands, I feel like it becomes a lot more important to me”<br><br>
Gabriel is a collector of video games and merchandise, mostly collecting for series that he's a big fan of. As a video game collector, he's very adamanant about physical media.
In recent years there's been more of a push towards digital media, throughout all sorts of different fields. This strange relationship between different means of owning something, leads to him saying he'd be fine with selling off his most valuable possession.
Despite being really excited and spending over $100 on the game Project Justice for the Dreamcast, he said he'd be perfectly fine with selling it off. He could still play the game, but he also keeps that memory.
Even though he may not have the game anymore in the future, he'll still have the excitement of stumbling across it in a store, which is infinitely more exciting than finding it online.

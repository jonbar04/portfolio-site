<p>&ldquo;It&rsquor;s a comfort object. And that&rsquor;s the easiest way to explain it. The world can be crashing down&comma; and I still have my stuffed dog.&rdquor;<br><br>
Alexander is a collector of plushies. They hold a special place in his heart&comma; and he uses them as a way to start a conversation&comma; similar to people who wear shirts of bands they like.
He believes that objects gain significance over the years&comma; being able to create memories with the journeys you take them on. Some of the significance may come from landmarks or rarity&comma; but mostly it&apos;s about making those memories and photographing the journey together.
He also refuses to part with his collection&comma; it doesn&apos;t matter how much money he can get from selling it off&comma; because the memories he made are priceless.

<h2><a href="docs/Interview 2.pdf">Interview 2&#58; Roman Hunter</a></h2>
</div>

<br>

<div class="paper">
<p>&ldquo;Even a pre-built computer can end up becoming something you can truly call your own&rdquor;<br><br>
Roman is a collector of music&comma; being newer to collecting&comma; but still having pride in his journey. Despite primarily collecting albums&comma; he claims that his most prized possession is his computer.
Computers are a special case&comma; since although you can just buy one off a shelf&comma; you can also make one yourself and/or continue modifying one as the years go by.
What makes this case even more interesting&comma; is that despite it being his most valuable possession&comma; Roman said he&apos;d be willing to part with it. This is of course due to the nature of a tool such as a computer.
While some would call it crazy to part with &quot;your most valuable possession&comma;&quot; tools can always be upgraded and replaced. And in the modern era&comma; it&apos;s become quite easy to preserve digital media&comma; leading to it becoming sort of a no-brainer.

<div class="paper">
<p>&ldquo;The value after the purchase is how I feel as the moment it&apos;s in my hands&comma; I feel like it becomes a lot more important to me&rdquor;<br><br>
Gabriel is a collector of video games and merchandise&comma; mostly collecting for series that he&apos;s a big fan of. As a video game collector&comma; he&apos;s very adamanant about physical media.
In recent years there&apos;s been more of a push towards digital media&comma; throughout all sorts of different fields. This strange relationship between different means of owning something&comma; leads to him saying he&apos;d be fine with selling off his most valuable possession.
Despite being really excited and spending over $100 on the game Project Justice for the Dreamcast&comma; he said he&apos;d be perfectly fine with selling it off. He could still play the game&comma; but he also keeps that memory.
Even though he may not have the game anymore in the future&comma; he&apos;ll still have the excitement of stumbling across it in a store&comma; which is infinitely more exciting than finding it online.

	<p>I had begun to assign more detailed materials here. Not everything was set in stone however, as seen with the unfinished texturing on the walls.
	I actually had to make this texture myself, and it was a very early draft of it just to see how it would look. It was left as this placeholder by the time I had to submit this milestone, which is why it persists here.
	And also why only one wall has proper tiling. A lot more detail began to pop thanks to normal maps, but there was still work to be done.

	<p>The finished product! I went for lighting showing that it was night time, so it's rather dark.
	There's only a few light sources. There's a few lanterns throughout the home, but the strongest light sources are the two windows and the fireplace.
	I honestly struggled quite a bit to find a good compromise for the fire effect, it ended up being just a cylindrical area light.
	I did drop in one of the fire fluid effects, but it is pretty hard to see through all of the light emitting from it.<br><br>
	
	Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this! There's probably a ton of imperfections I could catch, I would try and make the beds more fluffy if I knew how to do it and not mess up all my UVs, but it's good enough for me.
	I feel like the lighting choices really help with the presentation of the scene. That and the framing of the shots.
	I'm most proud of the first and fourth shots, I think those are my favorite angles that I captured the scene with.<br><br>
	
	It took a lot of work to get this far. There were a ton of hurdles I had to jump through and a ton of new things I had to learn, but I enjoyed it!
	For my first major modeling project, I'm pretty damn proud of it.

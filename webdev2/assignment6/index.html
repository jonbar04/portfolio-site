<p>As social media continues to evolve with each passing day, the concerns we have on its effects grow alongside it. Since its initial popularization in the 2000s with websites like MySpace and Facebook, social media has become more prevalent in our lives over the years. Initially conceived as a way to talk with people around the world in chat rooms, social media today takes on many forms, as well as having a much greater reach. It can be used to communicate with others, as a news source, or simply as entertainment. While a good idea on paper, as it has been given more time to develop, the &#34;cracks&#34; become more visible now that the generations that grew up with this technology are starting to mature. These &#34;cracks&#34; can range from basic safety concerns to unexpected mental side effects. Some of these concerns include behavioral, emotional, educational, development amongst others. Since our brains are developing rapidly at a young age, social media has stronger effects on the youth that use it. Whether it is someone with unmonitored and unlimited internet access as a kid seeing inappropriate content or someone with access to social media being self-conscious about their image, the things you consume in your youth can greatly impact you.</p>

<p>In recent years&comma; more and more studies attempting to analyze the true extent of this impact have been conducted&comma; and with this knowledge becoming more common&#45;place&comma; the general public has become concerned with how social media affects the youth. Despite different cultures around the world&comma; studies based in different countries seem to yield similar results when it comes to activity and general statistics. According to several studies&comma; over three&#45;fourths of 10&#45;12 year&#45;olds in the UK have social media accounts &#40;McDool et al.&#41;&comma; 90&percnt; of 14 year&#45;olds have phones &#40;Cano et al.&#41;&comma; 87&percnt; of youth aged 12&#45;17 across the world use the internet&comma; with 51&percnt; using it daily. Social media is everywhere&semi; Instagram alone reports over 2 billion monthly active users. The concerns we have as a society are not to be taken lightly&comma; these are major worldwide issues. For example&comma; social media&rsquor;s effect on mental health has become a concern for many. A term known as &ldquo;Facebook Depression&rdquor; has even been coined after studies have tried verifying the validity of these claims. Facebook Depression refers to a phenomenon where if someone spends a substantial amount of time on social media&comma; then they will start to exhibit symptoms of depression. While there are several studies that have claimed that this is the case&comma; since it&rsquor;s a more recent phenomenon&comma; it&rsquor;s unsure if this is an actual causation or merely a correlation &#40;Richards et al.&#41;. Although depression itself may not be directly caused by use of social media&comma; there is definitely an impact on mental health&comma; both positive and negative. The negative outlook primarily stems from the way that we use social media. A platform like Instagram&comma; again for example&comma; is an image sharing site&comma; where people can share whatever they&rsquor;d like about their lives&comma; whether it&rsquor;s everyday moments or grand celebrations. We get to pick and choose how we represent ourselves in social media&comma; which allows us to show the world our idealized form of ourselves&comma; leading others to see these forms&comma; which is the root of jealousy. It can be edited photos of oneself or an envy of social life&comma; but regardless it brings forth negative emotions &#40;McDool et al.&#41;. But it&rsquor;s not all negative&semi; wherever there&rsquor;s a negative&comma; there&rsquor;s also a positive.</p>

<p>A Dutch study finds that there is in fact both positive and negative feedback from social media&comma; with self&#45;esteem being at its highest when someone views or updates their own Facebook profile &#40;Richards et al.&#41;. However&comma; this goes back to representing the idealized self online&comma; which in turn&comma; makes the emotional feedback a double&#45;edged sword. But social media isn&rsquor;t all just about  body images&comma; it&rsquor;s been an evolution as to how we communicate. Over the past few decades&comma; communication across the globe has gotten substantially easier due to social media&comma; leading to these online spaces being more normalized and sometimes even necessary. This leads to a need for different skills in order to access these online spaces and be literate. According to an Australian study&comma; 70&percnt; of children aged 11&#45;16 are able to compare websites to see if information is true&comma; 76&percnt; can find information on how to use the internet safely&comma; and 80&percnt; can block messages from someone &#40;Green&#41;. Children are capable of learning these valuable skills and using the internet for good&comma; which is why we have to do a better job at protecting their safety. One of the most prominent examples is how easy it is to lie about your age online&comma; whether it&rsquor;s a child claiming to be older or an adult claiming to be younger&comma; there are many risks that come out of this one problem alone. People can access adult content at a young age&comma; one where they can&rsquor;t understand why it would be an issue or the significance of their actions. On the other end of the age spectrum&comma; it allows predators to run rampant in online spaces&comma; which is also helped by the anonymity social media brings. 12&percnt; of children aged 11&#45;16 in the UK have received unwanted sexual messages&comma; with 8&percnt; reporting requests to send sexual messages &#40;Cano et al.&#41;. Children are at risk in these online spaces&comma; but the main hurdle is how to tackle these issues.</p>

<p> Social media&comma; especially in its earlier days&comma; has been known for the freedom it allows&comma; particularly freedom of speech. However&comma; as social media has gotten more professional with businesses and news outlets turning to it as another medium to do business&comma; changes had to occur. More guidelines have had to be set in place&comma; and while some argue that this impedes on their rights&comma; it&rsquor;s for the greater good. However&comma; one topic that has been discussed for a few years now is identity verification. This would remove the concerns about people lying about their age and making social media accounts and entering adult spaces while being too young&comma; after all such a thing already exists in the real world. A child can&rsquor;t simply order a drink at a bar&comma; they ID you first. And while this sounds like a good solution&comma; there are multiple reasons why it would be a hassle to implement such a system. Firstly&comma; social media platforms would need to redo their entire infrastructure&comma; which requires money&comma; which is a major motivator. Say they do decide to redo their infrastructure&comma; would all previous accounts need to be verified&comma; annoying their users? If they are allowed to continue unverified&comma; with it only being a rule for new users&comma; the problem would still exist as long as old accounts were used. What about privacy concerns? If someone is using social media to protest&comma; a government could find their identity and do whatever they&rsquor;d want with that information. There is no easy solution to this problem&comma; so rather than directly solve the problem the best option we have is to bring awareness. Safety has been taught to children for ages&comma; the concept of &ldquo;stranger danger&rdquor; for example&comma; isn&rsquor;t something new. If children are able to become literate in online spaces&comma; more time should be dedicated to online safety&comma; especially as it becomes more commonplace. Warning signs should become known&comma; and various pieces of advice should be available at all times. This can be done in a function similar to a report method&comma; where if a user reports someone for unwanted advances&comma; there can be a sort of to-do list on how to escape the situation and ensure safety. There have already been indirect solutions for other issues&comma; such as screen time restrictions and timers for those who fear staying on social media for too long. Though direct solutions should also be in place for extreme scenarios. Identity verification may not have its place on social media platforms&comma; outside of for businesses and figures&comma; but in the case of an adult website there&rsquor;s no reason why it shouldn&rsquor;t be in place. If certain spaces are designated to be strictly for adults&comma; identity verification should not be an issue and should be mandatory in order to ensure that children do not enter that space.</p>

<p>Although we still don&rsquor;t have a firm grasp on the true extent of how social media affects the youth&comma; we should start taking more precautions to ensure their safety. The youth and the world in general is using social media now more than ever. Until we reach a definitive solution&comma; more roundabout protective measures should be commonplace&comma; start by teaching safety and offering support options. In more serious cases&comma; extreme measures such as identity verification should be in place to ensure the safety of children&comma; in order to avoid privacy concerns across all social media.</p>

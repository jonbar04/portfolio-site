	<p>	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The presence of artificial intelligence and its rapid growth has brought concern to many people in all sorts of different fields. And while I understand the fear, I personally feel like we’re at least going to remain safe for a bit longer. Some fields are more complex, if AI tries to create artwork the quality will vary heavily depending on the level of detail and criteria. For example a simple logo would probably not be much of a struggle, but something more intricate with a bunch of layers would leave more room for error. And while AI is considered a tool or advancement, there are a bunch of people opposed to it. The ethics of using artificial intelligence depends heavily on the context, something like Copilot for programming may be fine to some, but AI art is a very touchy subject for many. It’s the training of AI, using other people’s uncredited work, and attempting to replicate that art style, that bothers many. Of course, not everyone is willing to put in the effort to educate themselves, whether it’s for or against AI. Someone may just be entirely against AI while others simply don’t care at all.</p>
	<p>	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One of the most important aspects about the AI debate, is of course the economical perspective. Companies have done so many shady things over the years, whether it’s through legal loopholes or just being untouchable for whatever reason. But no matter what the purpose is, it always comes back to money. Cutting costs is important for businesses, which is why many people are afraid of AI replacing their jobs. No matter what happens, there will always be both sides of the coin whether we like it or not. “However, if a client or company wants to go the AI design route, that’s their prerogative, who are we to stop them.” And while it may be foolish optimism on my part, I disagree with the article on the main fear of losing jobs. We’ve had website designing tools and other sorts of options for a while now, and while they are getting more advanced, for better or worse, with AI, there will always be people looking for something greater. There’s a reason why people bother picking up skills, employers search for them, maybe it’s a hobby, maybe they’re just bored, who knows. But as long as jobs exist, there will be people looking for employees with the desired skill set.</p>
	<p>	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another aspect of this whole mess is the concept of a “Soul.” It’s honestly quite difficult to make an argument about something like this, since it’s an abstract concept, but it’s something quite a lot of people care about. There’s a certain static feeling that AI creations have, whether it’s the strange quirks of art, or the dialect that written AI has, being very encyclopedic. It’s not exactly in the uncanny valley, but it’s a similar sort of sensation. When someone creates art there’s some sort of inspiration behind it, whether they know it or not, their subconscious is always working. However, when AI is used to create something, it’s simply following prompts. These concepts are foreign to it, it can only work off of what is directly given to it. And while it’s something that sounds silly, the inspiration isn’t the only part that matters. Everyone has their own specific style of doing things, from their handwriting, to the format they use for things, to their art style and dialect. And while there are tons of different AI that have been trained off many different sources, at the end of the day they’re meant to be consistent. They will have a way of doing things unless otherwise instructed. There is no originality, and there is no soul. Sure, the designs created may be functional, but will they ever be appealing to the common man?</p>
